## Week 1 - History
- One writing system can be used by many languages
- Cuneiform basically evolved into a typewriter and into digital text now
- Cuneiform is thousand year old way of writing. They used it as numbers as well.

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Bytes is basically a group of bits
- Non-volatile memory ---> Hard drive, or SD card
- Volatile memory is used as short-term working memory, it's usually much faster but much more expensive
- Long term memory ---> storage or disk
- Volatile working memory ---> usually called RAM

## Week 3 - .MD and JSON
- Alphanumeric ---> letters and digits (ex. a,b,c and 0 to 9)
- Non-alphanumeric ---> everything else (ex. {[(+-;)]} )
- | ---> pipe, vertical line
- ~ ---> tilde
- ^ ---> caret
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
* XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
   * Both are text-based formats used to serialize structured data. they are intended to be read by computer software, but still be human-readable

## Week 4 - Keyboard and Editors
- Keyboard Mastery: Efficient typing reduces cognitive load
- Types: Standard 104-key layout
         Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards
- Layouts:
-   QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak
- Modifier Keys: modify the behaviour of the other keys - Control, Shift, Alt.
- Touch typing: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue
Text Editors
- Types:
-   Word Processors (e.g. Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g. Notepad)
-   IDEs: Intergrated Development Environment like Webstorm, and Pycharm

## Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces
Modern CLI usage:
- Advantages:
-   Some functionalities are only available via CLI
-   Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces
-   Easier automation through scripting
-   Efficient for remot work with low bandwidth requirements
-   Minimal resource usage on computers

Basic CLI Commands:
- Navigation and File Management:
-   ls: List files in a directory
-   cd: Change directory
-   pwd: Print working directory
-   cat: Display file contents
-   less: view file contents interactively
-   cp: Copy files
-   mv: Move files
-   ping: Test network connectivity

Advance Commands:
- grep: Serach text using patterns

Remote Access and Security:
- SSH (Secure Shell)
-   Connect to remote computers securely
-   Allows command line access to remote systems
- File Transfer:
-   scp: Securely copy files between computers
-   sftp: Secure file transfer protocol

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Integration:
-   Run Linux within windows for development
-   Use linux tools and commands alongside windows applications
